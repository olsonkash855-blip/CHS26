Create and Test a Simple "About Me" Webpage Using GitHub Desktop and G.HTMLTut
Goal: Step-by-step instructions for creating, editing, and testing a simple "About Me" webpage stored in a file named G.HTMLTut in your cloned fork of https://github.com/MrTeuters22/CHS26 using GitHub Desktop. Clear, age-appropriate steps for 9th‑grade students.
Before you begin

You need GitHub Desktop installed and signed in.
You need a fork of https://github.com/MrTeuters22/CHS26 (teacher or repo owner likely already forked it to your account).
You should have cloned your fork to your computer using GitHub Desktop.
Locate the repository folder on your computer (GitHub Desktop shows the local path).

Procedure


Open the repository in GitHub Desktop

Launch GitHub Desktop.
In the list of repositories, select your fork of CHS26.
Confirm the current branch is main (or the branch your teacher asked you to use).



Locate the file G.HTMLTut

Click Repository > Show in Explorer (Windows) or Repository > Show in Finder (Mac).
In the repository folder, find the file named G.HTMLTut. If it does not exist, create it (see step 4).



Make a safe copy (optional but recommended)

Right-click G.HTMLTut and choose Copy, then Paste as G.HTMLTut.backup in the same folder. This preserves the original if you need to revert.



Create or open G.HTMLTut in a text editor

If G.HTMLTut exists: open it in a simple text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad, or TextEdit set to plain text).
If it does not exist: create a new file named exactly G.HTMLTut (no extra extension change) and open it.
Ensure the file contents will be HTML code. Save frequently.



Write basic HTML for an "About Me" page

Type the following structure into G.HTMLTut (replace bracketed text with your own info):

A simple page includes: a document type, html, head (with a title), and body (with headings, paragraph, and an image or list).


Example structure to write in the file (use your own words for the content):

- 
- About Me — [Your Name]
- 



- About Me
- Hello! My name is [Your Name]. I like [hobby or subject].
- Favorites
- 
  - Favorite subject: [subject]
  - Favorite hobby: [hobby]
  - 
- Contact: [optional email or class handle]
- 

Save the file as G.HTMLTut.

Note: Even though the file name is G.HTMLTut (not .html), most browsers will still display valid HTML if you open the file. If your teacher requires .html extension, save a copy as G.html instead.


Preview the page in a web browser

Open your file manager and navigate to the repository folder.
Double-click G.HTMLTut. If your computer recognizes it as an HTML file, it will open in your default browser and display the page.
If double-clicking does not open a browser, open a browser and use File > Open File (or drag the file into the browser window) to load G.HTMLTut.
If the file doesn’t render because of the unusual extension, open G.HTMLTut in your editor, choose Save As, and save a copy named G.html, then open G.html in the browser.



Make edits and test iteratively

Return to your text editor, change text, add a new paragraph, or add an image tag pointing to an image in the repo.
Save the file, then refresh the open browser tab to see changes.
Repeat until you are satisfied.



Stage and commit changes in GitHub Desktop

Go back to GitHub Desktop.
You will see changed files listed in the Changes panel (G.HTMLTut or G.html).
In the Summary box, type a short commit message like: "Add About Me page draft".
Click Commit to main (or Commit to branch) to create a local commit.



Publish or push your commit to GitHub

If this is the first commit since cloning, click Push origin in GitHub Desktop to upload your commit to your fork on GitHub.
Confirm on github.com under your forked repo that the file and commit appear.



(Optional) Create a pull request

If your teacher wants work merged upstream, open your fork on GitHub and click Compare & pull request to request merging your changes into the original CHS26 repo. Follow teacher instructions for branch naming or PR description.



Troubleshooting

If browser shows raw text or code: ensure the file contains proper HTML structure and is opened as a file in the browser, or rename to have a .html extension.
If GitHub Desktop shows no changes: verify you saved the file in the repository folder and not elsewhere.
If push fails: check internet connection and that you are signed into the correct GitHub account in GitHub Desktop.
